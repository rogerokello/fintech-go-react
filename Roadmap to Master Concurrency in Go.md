## 3. Concurrency Patterns (Practical Level)

### a. Worker Pool Pattern
- Process tasks using a fixed number of worker goroutines.
    - [Worker Pool Pattern in Go](https://gobyexample.com/worker-pools)

### b. Pipeline Pattern
- Chain stages of data processing using channels.
    - [Pipeline Pattern in Go](https://blog.golang.org/pipelines)

### c. Fan-Out / Fan-In Pattern
- Fan-Out: Distribute tasks among multiple goroutines.
- Fan-In: Combine results into a single channel.
    - [Fan-Out/Fan-In Explained](https://medium.com/@matryer/go-handlers-with-concurrency-and-fan-in-fan-out-patterns-5c5f6d0dbf5e)

### d. Throttling
- Limit the number of goroutines running concurrently.
    - [Throttling Goroutines](https://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/handlers#Throttle)

- Use `sync.Mutex` and `sync.RWMutex` to protect shared resources.
    - [Go Mutex Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/sync#Mutex)
    - [Understanding Mutex](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-mutexes-in-go)

### b. Condition Variables
- Use `sync.Cond` for advanced coordination between goroutines.
    - [Condition Variables in Go](https://pkg.go.dev/sync#Cond)

### c. Atomic Operations
- Use `sync/atomic` for low-level, lock-free synchronization.
    - [Atomic Operations in Go](https://pkg.go.dev/sync/atomic)

## 8. Distributed Concurrency

### a. Worker Pools in Distributed Systems
- Build distributed worker pools using RPC or gRPC.
